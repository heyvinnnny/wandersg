For a heartier, full bodied main course, try the 150 Days Grain-Fed Angus Braised Beef Cheek. The beef is cooked for long hours so that the meat is meltingly soft and fork-tender, suffused with a rich, heady flavour from the gravy. Be sure to save some space for dessert. Classics like the Apple Crumble and a delicious, warm Chocolate Lava Cake are sweet comforts to indulge in at the end of the meal. \")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('p',{staticClass:\"text-muted text-sm\"},[_vm._v(\" 107 North Bridge Road\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" #02-17\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" Funan Mall\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" Singapore (179105)\"),_c('br')])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","<template>\r\n  <div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n    <parallax class=\"page-header header-filter\" :style=\"headerStyle\">\r\n      <div class=\"md-layout\">\r\n        <div class=\"md-layout-item\">\r\n          <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\r\n            <div class=\"brand\">\r\n              <h1 style=\"color:white;\">Description</h1>\r\n              <h3 style=\"color:white;\">\r\n                Information of your favourite activity and restaurant.\r\n              </h3>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </parallax>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"main main-raised\">\r\n      <div class=\"section section-basic\">\r\n        <!-- RESTAURANT CAROUSEL SECTION-->\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"md-layout\">\r\n          <div class=\"md-layout-item md-size-66 mx-auto md-small-size-100\">\r\n            <h1 class=\"text-uppercase lined mb-4\" style=\"color:palevioletred\">\r\n              5 Senses Bistro (Funan Mall)\r\n              <md-button\r\n                v-if=\"loggedIn\"\r\n                v-bind:class=\"getClass()\"\r\n                v-on:click=\"checkIfFav()\"\r\n                style=\"margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px\"\r\n                ><md-icon>favorite</md-icon></md-button\r\n              >\r\n            </h1>\r\n\r\n            <md-card>\r\n              <carousel\r\n                :per-page=\"1\"\r\n                loop\r\n                :speed=\"700\"\r\n                autoplay\r\n                :autoplay-timeout=\"5000\"\r\n                :mouse-drag=\"false\"\r\n                navigationEnabled\r\n                navigationNextLabel=\"<i class='material-icons'>keyboard_arrow_right</i>\"\r\n                navigationPrevLabel=\"<i class='material-icons'>keyboard_arrow_left</i>\"\r\n              >\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img src=\"@/assets/res-img/rs0010-1.jpg\" alt=\"carousel1\" />\r\n                </slide>\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img src=\"@/assets/res-img/rs0010-2.jpg\" alt=\"carousel2\" />\r\n                </slide>\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img src=\"@/assets/res-img/rs0010-3.jpg\" alt=\"carousel2\" />\r\n                </slide>\r\n              </carousel>\r\n            </md-card>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <br />\r\n\r\n        <!-- DESCRIPTION SECTION        -->\r\n        <div class=\"pb-5\">\r\n          <div class=\"container\">\r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n              <div class=\"col-lg-8\">\r\n                <h3 class=\"text-uppercase lined mb-4\" style=\"color:#ff286c\">\r\n                  Restaurant Information\r\n                </h3>\r\n                <p class=\"text-muted\">\r\n                  Following the philosophy that good food can also be affordably\r\n                  priced, 5 Senses Bistro serves up comfort dishes, reminiscent\r\n                  of mama’s cooking.

One of the must-see features of the Science Centre Singapore is the Singapore Omni Theatre, Singapore’s only dome-shaped, 5-story high theatre using the world’s latest and brightest 8K Digital Fulldome System. Butterfly lovers will also enjoy Butterflies Up-Close, the centre’s very own indoor butterfly sanctuary, which will give visitors a closer glimpse into the life cycle of these winged creatures. You can also observe various butterfly specimens and how a butterfly behaves in this live butterfly enclosure. \")])])},function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('p',{staticClass:\"text-muted text-sm\"},[_vm._v(\" 15 Science Centre Rd\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" Singapore (609081) \")])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","<template>\r\n  <div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n    <parallax class=\"page-header header-filter\" :style=\"headerStyle\">\r\n      <div class=\"md-layout\">\r\n        <div class=\"md-layout-item\">\r\n          <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\r\n            <div class=\"brand\">\r\n              <h1 style=\"color:white;\">Description</h1>\r\n              <h3 style=\"color:white;\">\r\n                Information of your favourite activity and restaurant.\r\n              </h3>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </parallax>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"main main-raised\">\r\n      <div class=\"section section-basic\">\r\n        <!-- activity CAROUSEL SECTION-->\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"md-layout\">\r\n          <div class=\"md-layout-item md-size-66 mx-auto md-small-size-100\">\r\n            <h1 class=\"text-uppercase lined mb-4\" style=\"color:palevioletred\">\r\n              Science Centre\r\n              <md-button\r\n                v-if=\"loggedIn\"\r\n                v-bind:class=\"getClass()\"\r\n                v-on:click=\"checkIfFav()\"\r\n                style=\"margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px\"\r\n                ><md-icon>favorite</md-icon></md-button\r\n              >\r\n            </h1>\r\n\r\n            <md-card>\r\n              <carousel\r\n                :per-page=\"1\"\r\n                loop\r\n                :speed=\"700\"\r\n                autoplay\r\n                :autoplay-timeout=\"5000\"\r\n                :mouse-drag=\"false\"\r\n                navigationEnabled\r\n                navigationNextLabel=\"<i class='material-icons'>keyboard_arrow_right</i>\"\r\n                navigationPrevLabel=\"<i class='material-icons'>keyboard_arrow_left</i>\"\r\n                style=\"height:600px;\"\r\n              >\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img src=\"@/assets/act-img/m0002-1.jpg\" alt=\"carousel1\" />\r\n                </slide>\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img\r\n                    src=\"@/assets/act-img/m0002-2.jpg\"\r\n                    alt=\"carousel2\"\r\n                    style=\"height:auto;\"\r\n                  />\r\n                </slide>\r\n                <slide>\r\n                  <div class=\"carousel-caption\">\r\n                    <h4></h4>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <img src=\"@/assets/act-img/m0002-3.jpg\" alt=\"carousel2\" />\r\n                </slide>\r\n              </carousel>\r\n            </md-card>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <br />\r\n\r\n        <!-- DESCRIPTION SECTION        -->\r\n        <div class=\"pb-5\">\r\n          <div class=\"container\">\r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n              <div class=\"col-lg-8\">\r\n                <h3 class=\"text-uppercase lined mb-4\" style=\"color:#ff286c\">\r\n                  Attraction Description\r\n                </h3>\r\n                <p class=\"text-muted\">\r\n                  Make the most of your children’s school holidays or birthday\r\n                  party and take the whole family to Science Centre Singapore.\r\n                  The learning institution is considered one of the top science\r\n                  centres in the world.
